2.	Student's t-test: p-value = 0.0, Null Hypothesis is rejected.
Permutation test: p-value: 0.02, Null Hypothesis is rejected.
For both tests, the alpha value was set at 0.05.
3.	Comparison of mean values in groups with 95% confidence intervals:

4.	Two groups of approx. 10,000 people who passed the onboarding stage were offered a paid subscription. Group A was shown a standard subscription design, Group B received a design with a postscript saying it was a 50% off offer.
The conversion to payment of Group B was 2.8% higher than Group A. To make sure that the result is higher than the level of static error, a Student's test was performed, which showed that the result was statistically significant. Since the standard deviation in both groups is slightly different, a permutation test was additionally performed, which confirmed the results of the first test.
So, the difference is statistically significant, as can be seen from the 'A/B Test Results' graph. Recommendation: apply the design option with an assigned discount on an ongoing basis.

5.	Graph of conversion changes over time:
